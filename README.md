# User Manager
This service is handling the registration and login of users, and the creation
of access token for authentication.

## Managing the Environment and Dependencies
First install `virtualenv` with pip.
```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

Then create an empty virtual environment.
```bash
virtualenv .venv
```
Note that `.venv` is the name of the virtual environment directory, this
directory is omitted in the `.gitignore` file.

After creating the virtual environment, activate it.

UNIX based Operating Systems (GNU/Linux, macOS, etc.)
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Windows
```batch
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

Now you can install the required python packages in the clean environment you
just created.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Service
After installing the dependencies, you can go to the `app` directory and then
run the service by executing the following command.
```bash
python main.py
```
If you want to change the port number, you can do so by changing the `PORT`
constant in the `settings.py` file.
